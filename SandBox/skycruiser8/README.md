This folder is used as a sandbox (as the parent folder name suggests) to learn things related to Git and GitHub. This folder is part of a collective effort by the lecturer and students of Operating Systems (CSGE602055) 2020-1 course.

Among other things, topics that are evaluated in this sandbox folder include:

1. Basic Git commands (init, remote, fetch, pull, add, commit, push, clone, stash)
2. Markdown syntax
3. Commit signing using GPG
4. Bash scripting language
5. Python programming language
6. *And more to come...*
